## Inspiration
Outside of my computer science journey, I am also a book writer. Particularly, I am interested in fantasy stories. Writing books has been a long-term goal on my to-do list since primary school. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish any of those until now. One reason I realized from writing a fantasy book is the step of world creation, those various ideas that come to my mind and character settings that I wish to depict. They were seem too overwhelming and time-spending to complete those tasks.

Therefore, AI comes to my mind.

## What it does
Compared to letting AI write stories directly, Turquoise focuses more on the structural building. While users input their ideas in the window, AI helps the user to store and update character settings and help the user to build an outline for it. Users can edit the outline including the storylines, world lines, every single character's stories, etc. 

## How we built it
This project will eventually cover through website and phone app.
